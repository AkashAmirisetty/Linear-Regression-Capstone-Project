# ðŸ“Š Linear Regression Capstone Project

This repository presents my capstone project focused on applying **Linear Regression** to real-world datasets using Python. The goal is to understand, build, and evaluate linear regression models for prediction tasks through practical datasets.

Project Overview
This project involves solving regression problems using scikit-learn's linear regression model. It includes:

Cleaning and preprocessing the data

Visualizing relationships between variables

Training and testing linear regression models

Evaluating model performance using metrics like RÂ² and RMSE

Drawing business insights from the results

Features: Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Number of Rooms, etc.

Target: Price

Objective: Predict housing prices based on features

2. Ecommerce Customers
Features: Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership, etc.

Target: Yearly Amount Spent

Objective: Help an e-commerce business improve marketing strategy

Tools & Libraries
